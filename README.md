The *Synthetic Causal Framework* (SCF) is a novel methodological framework for deriving reliable and valid causal inference for non-manipulable phenomena through use of synthetic units. These units are generated by synthesizing simulated data (i.e., units with simulated characteristics proportional to the population of interest) with real-world data (i.e., human characteristics expressed in text) in the form of life-histories generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The research paper produced from this project, [*The Synthetic Causal Framework: An LLM-based Solution to the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference*]^(https://emeyer-hansen.github.io/synthetic-causal-framework) (newest version published 2025-03-18), reviews and develops the theory underlying this procedure and tests its reliability and validity against robust causal results derived from human populations. This paper subscribes to the open science standard and is made freely available.
